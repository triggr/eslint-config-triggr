## eslint-config-triggr

This package includes common ESLint rules that should be enabled for
all Triggr Health projects. Projects must also inherit from a base
ruleset, such as eslint:recommended.

Some legacy code still uses jshint+jscs, but newer projects use ESLint.

See http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs for a
description of ESLint shareable configs.
